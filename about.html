<p>I,m <b>Mohit kumar Bajoria</b>, 2nd year undergraduate student and web developer. During the day time, you would find me sleeping but at night you would find me glued to my laptop. I love to explore new technologies and i believe in open source.</p>

<p>I have been selected as <b>Google Summer of Code</b> Intern at <b>Mifos Initiative</b>. I have been actively contributing to open source since 2015.</p>

<p>I am an open source enthusiast who loves to play with code. I like exploring various repositories to learn new things and gain experiences.</p>

<p>I am highly addicted to music. I always prefer soothing music during my working hours that keeps me refreshed ;)</p>
