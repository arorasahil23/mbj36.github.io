I was waiting eagerly at the midnight for the my <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a>
GSOC
Result. Anxiousness was at great height.I was almost sweating and couldn't sleep from last 30 hours. Then the result came out and i was SELECTED for the project which i made the proposal just 3 hours before the deadline. 

<code>Yes ! I made it to GSOC ;)</code>

It was the moment which will be cherished forever and then i shared the news with my family and friends. They all were super-duper happy for me.


It really feels great to be a part of GSOC :D

I got to learn about GSOC from my senior who is doing Cool stuffs in machine learning these days :D. Without his help it would be very much difficult for me to crack in my 2nd year only. A real Big Thanks to him.


I was selected in GSOC under Mifos Initiative.

Mifos is a diverse community of microfinance institutions, technology professionals, business people, volunteers, and contributors. I am really excited to start working on my project "Browser Based Offline access" this summer.
